# Cyberattacks!
Hackers have taken notice of your systems as the company has become more well known. You will now have to deal with products that become compromised by cyberattacks.

You will monitor for products that have been identified by the security team as being compromised, and patch them.

You will also train one other person on how to deploy products to production, and yourself become cross-trained in one other role, to help with any bottlenecks.
