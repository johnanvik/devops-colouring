# Cyberattacks!
Hackers have taken notice of your systems as the company has become more well known. You will now have to deal with products that become compromised by cyberattacks.

If a product you are testing is hacked, you will have to wait for security and system administation to patch it before it can be submitted to Release.

You will also train one other person on how to test a product, and yourself become cross-trained in one other role, to help with any bottlenecks.

# Actions This Sprint
## Setup
1. Talk to one other person and explain what you do.
