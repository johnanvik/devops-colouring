# Cyberattacks!
Hackers have taken notice of your systems as the company has become more well-known. You will now have to deal with products that become compromised by cyberattacks.

If a product in development or testing is hacked, you will identify the product as compromised so that the system administration can patch it.

Recognizing the importance of having security issues addressed sooner in the development cycle, you will be working closely with the development and testing team.

You will also become cross-trained in one other role, to help with any bottlenecks.

# Actions This Sprint
## Setup
1. Explain to each development team how to know if their issue will have a security flaw.
    - This process is known as "shifting left".
    - Developers and testers can now identify and address a security issue early in the development process.
         - Any developer or tester who runs and passes a security check for their issue adds the "Security Checked" label to the issue.
         - Issues with the "Security Checked" label do not require further examination by Security.    
        
1. Talk to one other person and explain what you do.
   - This person will now be able to check issues for security flaws and set items in "Security" to "Deployment" status.

## Sprint Planning
1. For each development and testing team you are responsible for:
   - Find the filter text box that says "status:Security"
   - Add "status:Development - Team <#>"
   - Add "status:Testing - Team <#>"

## Sprint Execution
1. Monitor the "Development - Team <#>" and "Testing - Team <#>" issues for the "Hacked" label.
    - Change the "Hacked" label to "Compromised"
    - Change the status to "Security"
1. Fulfill whatever role you were cross-trained in, as needed. 

## Sprint Review
Discuss with your team (Development, Testing, Security) the following three questions:
1. What are the top two things that went well?
1. What are the top two things that did not go so well?
1. What are two changes your team would like to make in the next sprint?
