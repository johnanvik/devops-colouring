# Cyberattacks!
Hackers have taken notice of your systems as the company has become more well known. You will now have to deal with products that become compromised by cyberattacks.

If a product in development or testing is hacked, you will idenfiy the product as compromised so that the system administation can patch it.

Recognizing the importance of having security issues addressed sooner in the development cycle, you will be working closer with the development and testing team.

You will also become cross-trained in one other role, to help with any bottlenecks.

# Actions This Sprint
## Setup
1. Select a random prime number from the set [3, 5, 7, 11]
    - Tell the development and testing team what this number is.
    - Explain how that number is used to identify a security flaw.
        - This will allow the team to identify and address a security issue early in the development process.
1. Talk to one other person and explain what you do.
   - This person will now be able to set items in "Security" to "Deployment" status.
1. Add the "Development - \<Team Number>" and "Testing - \<Team Number>" status to the Securoty board.

## Sprint Execution
1. Monitor the "Development - \<Team Number>" and "Testing - \<Team Number>" issues for the "Hacked" label.
    - Change the "Hacked" label to "Compromised"
    - Change the status to "Security"
1. Fulfill whatever role you were cross-trained in, as needed.
