# Cyberattacks!
Hackers have taken notice of your systems as the company has become more well known. You will now have to deal with products that become compromised by cyberattacks.

If a product that is set for release is hacked, you will have to wait for security and system administation to patch it before it can be submitted to Deployment.

You will also train one other person on how to deploy a batch of products, and yourself become cross-trained in one other role, to help with any bottlenecks.

# Actions This Sprint
## Setup
1. Talk to one other person and explain what you do.
   - This person will now be able to create an issue with a batch of products and set the status to "Release".

## Sprint Execution
1. Create issues with links to completed drawings as before.
    - If one of the issues is labeled "Hacked" the batch issue cannot be moved to "Deployment" until it is labeled "Patched"
1. Fulfill whatever role you were cross-trained in, as needed.

## Sprint Review
Discuss with your team (Release and System Admin) the following three questions:
1. What are the top two things that went well?
1. What are the top two things that did not go so well?
1. What are two changes your team would like to make in the next sprint?
