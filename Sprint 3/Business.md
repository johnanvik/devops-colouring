# The Market Continues to Change!
Your competitors caught on to the new car and boat market. You will have to get more innovative to stay ahead. Fantasy and science fictioin is really hot now, so it is time for unicorns and aliens!

Also, waiting for batches of drawings is taking too long. You need your drawings as soon as possible and will accept individual drawings as soon as they are available (i.e. batch sizes of 1).

With new car and boat drawings now on in the market, these drawings don't sell as well as before and their prices have dropped, as well as dog, cat and bird prices dropping lower.
