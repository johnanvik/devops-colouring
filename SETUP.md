1. Create a CSV file called `students.csv` in the scripts folder
1. Add the GitHub user names of all the students to the CSV file, one user name per line.
1. On a Unix command-line run the following commands:
   - `gh auth login`
        - Log into GitHub from the commandline
        - You may need to create a fine-grained personal access token for the organization (https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization)
           - Go to `Organizations` under your account

           - Set Repository Access to "All repositories"
           - Set the permissions to "Adminstrator"
    - `./add-users-to-team-from-list.sh students.csv <org> its-devsecops`
        - \<org> is organization you created for this activity.
