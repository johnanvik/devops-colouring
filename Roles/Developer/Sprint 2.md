# Cyberattacks!
Hackers have taken notice of your systems as the company has become more well known. You will now have to deal with products that become compromised by cyberattacks.

If a product you are working is hacked, you will have to wait for security and system administation to patch it before it can be submitted to Testing.

You will also train one other person on how to create a product, and yourself become cross-trained in one other role, to help with any bottlenecks.

# Sprint Activities
Refer to the **Sprint 1** document for a refresher of the role.

## Cross-train for Another Role

**You are now able to do this role, if needed.**

## Shift-Left on Security and Being Hacked
1. The `Security` person will explain how to know if your issue will have a security flaw.
