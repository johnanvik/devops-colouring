# Cyberattacks!
Hackers have taken notice of your systems as the company has become more well-known. You will now have to deal with products that become compromised by cyberattacks.

If a product in development or testing is hacked, you will identify the product as compromised so that the system administration can patch it.

Recognizing the importance of having security issues addressed sooner in the development cycle, you will be working closely with the development and testing team.

You will also become cross-trained in one other role, to help with any bottlenecks.

# Sprint Activities
Refer to the **Sprint 1** document for a refresher of the role.

## Cross-train for Another Role
1. Roll a [4-sided die](https://rolladie.net/roll-a-d4-die).
1. Read the **Sprint 1** document for the rolled role:    
    1. Developer
    1. Tester
    1. Security
    1. Admin

**You are now able to do this role, if needed.**

# Actions This Sprint
## Shift-Left on Security
1. Explain to your development team how to know if their issue will have a security flaw.
   - Developers and testers can now identify and address a security issue early in the development process.
   - A developer or tester who runs and passes a security check for their issue adds the `Security Checked` label to the issue.
      - Issues with the `Security Checked` label do not require further examination by Security.    
        
## Sprint Execution
1. Complete this part as in Sprint 1.
   - If an issue has a `Security Checked` label, don't check it. 
1. Monitor the `Development` and `Testing` columns.
   - If an issues has a `Hacked` label:
      1. Change the **Hacked** label to **Compromised**
      1. Change the **Status** to **Security**
1. Fulfill whatever role you were cross-trained in, as needed.
