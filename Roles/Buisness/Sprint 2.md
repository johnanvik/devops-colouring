# The Market Has Changed!
Your competitors have now flooded the market with drawings of dogs, cats and birds, so these drawings no longer sell for what they used to. As indicated below the prices for these drawings have dropped.

The public is now demanding drawings of cars and boats. These will fetch bigger prices than dogs, cats and birds ever did!
