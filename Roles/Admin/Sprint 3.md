# Process Improvements
With the time that was freed up due to cross training, you have been able to learn about some technologoes to improve the product development process.

## Continous Integration and Delivery
You have created an automated pipeline where products are tested and deployed automatically. From now on, products can move directly from **Development** to **Production**.

## Creating Secured Containers for Microservices 
You have created a repository of _containers_ (e.g. Docker) that developers and testers can use to self-serve creating secured development environments. These containers are running all the latest libraries (i.e. secured), so products in containers cannot be hacked.

# Sprint Actions
## Containerize Products
1. Add a **Container** label to any issues that are still in **Deployment** to represent the move to using containers.
1. Set their **Status** to **Production**

## Managing Containers
Moving to containers has resulted in a more secure and efficient production enviroment. However, you now have to keep an eye on the containers and restart them as needed. 

1. Montitor the **Production** enviroment for issues with the **Stopped** label.
   - Remove the `Stopped` label if found to simulate restarting the container.
1. Fulfill whatever role you were cross-trained in, as needed.

## Sprint Review
Discuss with your Business and Operations team (Business, Release and System Admin) the following three questions:
1. What are the top two things that went well?
1. What are the top two things that did not go so well?
1. What are two changes your team would like to make in the next sprint?
