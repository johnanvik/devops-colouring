# Cyberattacks!
Hackers have taken notice of your systems as the company has become more well known. You will now have to deal with products that become compromised by cyberattacks.

You will monitor for products that have been identified by the security team as being compromised, and patch them.

You will also train one other person on how to deploy products to production, and yourself become cross-trained in one other role, to help with any bottlenecks.

# Sprint Activities
Refer to the **Sprint 1** document for a refresher of the role.

## Cross-train for Another Role
1. Roll a [4-sided die](https://rolladie.net/roll-a-d4-die).
1. Read the **Sprint 1** document for the rolled role:    
    1. Developer
    1. Tester
    1. Release 
    1. Security

**You are now able to do this role, if needed.**

# Sprint Execution
1. Set issues with status **Deployment** to status **Production**
1. If an issue has the label **Comprimises**:
    1. Replace **Compromised** label with **Patched** label for issues with status **Security**
        - This simulates a system administrator patching a software package where a vulnerability has been discovered.
    1. Change the **Status** to **Development**
1. Fulfill whatever role you were cross-trained in, as needed.

## Sprint Review
Discuss with your Business and Operations team (Business, Release and System Admin) the following three questions:
1. What are the top two things that went well?
1. What are the top two things that did not go so well?
1. What are two changes your team would like to make in the next sprint?
