# Sprint Activities

## Starting Place
1. Go to the `Admin` tab of the project board.

## Sprint Execution
1. Monitor the `Admin` board for release packages with a `Deployment` status.
    - If not in a code freeze (i.e. last 2 minutes of the sprint):
        - Set status of release package to `Production`
    - If in code freeze:
        - Add label `Code Freeze` to the release package.
1. A code freeze happens when there is 2 minutes left in the sprint.

### What is a code freeze?
A _code freeze_ is a period during software development when no new code changes are allowed, aimed at stabilizing the codebase before a major release or milestone. This practice helps ensure that the software remains stable and ready for deployment by focusing on testing and debugging existing code.

# Sprint Review
Discuss with your team (Release and System Admin) the following three questions:
1. What are the top two things that went well?
1. What are the top two things that did not go so well?
1. What are two changes your team would like to make in the next sprint?
