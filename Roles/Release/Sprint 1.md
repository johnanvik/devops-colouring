# Sprint Activities
## Starting Place
1. Go to the `Release` tab of the project board.
1. Monitor the `Release` column for:
   - Product requests - to know the number of completed issues to batch.
   - Completed issues - to create the release package.
   - Corrected issues - issues that were part of a release package that either:
      - Failed the security check.
      - Not accepted by `Buisness`

## Create Release Packages
1. Once there are enough issues from a team to meet the batch requirements for a product request:
   1. Note the issue ids of the issues to be batched.
   1. Click the title of the product request.
   1. Click the down arrow of the **Create sub-issue** drop down.
      - This will be in the same textbox as the drawing URL.
   1. Select **Add existing issue**
   1. Enter the id of one of the completed issues to be batched.
   1. Select the issue.
   1. Continue adding sub-issues until the number of sub-issues is the same as the number in the batch size label.
   1. Set the **Status** to **Security**
      - Dropdown under `Projects` on the lefthand side.

## Corrected Issues
1. Change the **Status** of an issue has either a **Needs Work** or **Security Flaw** label to **Security**.
